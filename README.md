Professional profile 
# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrea Holmes

I'm a strategic leader with over 10 years of experience launching high-impact initiatives, managing cross-functional teams, and navigating public-sector partnerships. My work focuses on designing and executing complex projects that deliver lasting community impact — especially in post-disaster recovery and public infrastructure.

💼 Most recently, I led multidisciplinary teams in supporting cities and counties across California in needs assessment, strategic planning, and program implementation.

🔥 I'm particularly inspired by Homebound's mission to rebuild wildfire-affected communities in Los Angeles, and I’m excited to bring my experience in stakeholder engagement, government relations, and market entry to a role that blends innovation, purpose, and execution.
